Welcome to :green[**Urban Loom**], a Machine Learning project that predicts :violet[**traffic density**] and :violet[**estimates CO‚ÇÇ emissions**] in a futuristic city based on various urban factors.

This application is built with a machine learning model that analyzes key factors like weather, time of day, and vehicle types to provide accurate traffic predictions. It also includes a unique feature to demonstrate the environmental impact of transitioning to electric and autonomous vehicles.

### :red[Key Features:]
- :orange[**Traffic Prediction**:] Predict traffic density in real-time based on various urban conditions.
- :orange[**Data Visualization**:] Explore key patterns and relationships in the dataset used for training.
- :orange[**Model Information**:] Learn about the machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- :orange[**What-If Scenario**:] Explore a hypothetical future where a percentage of vehicles are electric and see the impact on CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
- :orange[**Feedback**:] Provide your valuable thoughts and suggestions for the app.
